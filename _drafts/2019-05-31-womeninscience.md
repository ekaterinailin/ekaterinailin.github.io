I would be very happy if you could participate!

If you want to participate, please let me know


    Your age,
    Your position (master student, PhD student, etc)
    What your research is about in 1-3 sentences

My name is Ekaterina Ilin, and I am first year PhD student at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam, Germany. In my research, I try to understand how the magnetic fields of stars evolve over time, and how they influence their surroundings. Flares are energetic eruptions on stellar surfaces that can tell us a great deal about the star itself. They are not only fascinating phenomena, but affect the habitability of planets that orbit a flaring star.

What inspired you to pursue a career in science / physics?

I was brought up in a family of scientists and engineers. My parent both studied physics. I have seen what it is like to be a scientist, but not much else. So the choice to study physics was largely dominated by an availability bias and a positive emotional attachment to the subject. Thorughout my studies, I cultivated the feeling that I wanted to try to answer the fundamental questions that there are. This naturally had me lean towards astronomy. There was no distinct moment of inspiration to my career choice. 

Who are your role models?

My fictive role model is a diffuse mix of Soviet science-fiction heroes with a speck of J. K. Rowling's Hermione. Otherwise, I admire a number of more senior women in my field. Their integrity, open-mindedness, support for juniors, not to mention the great science they all do really transform the way science is done in astronomy. If I can balance being humble and approachable while doing all the fancy science stuff as they seem to effortlessly, science will benefit on many levels.

How did you get to where you are in your career path? [name your background, single career steps, important mentors, scientific programs and faced (and overcome) obstacles / challenges, etc]

I studied physics, then became 
    What is the coolest project you have worked on and why?
    What's a time you felt immense pride in yourself / your work?
    What is a "day in the life" of you like?
    What are you seeking to accomplish in your career?
    What do you like to do when you're not doing research?
    What advice do you have for other women interested in science / physics?
    In your opinion, what will be the next great breakthrough in science / physics?
    What should be done to increase the number of female scientists and female professors?
