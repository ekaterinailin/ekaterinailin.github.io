  My CV.

     I was born in Moscow, but my parents took me to Germany (Jülich) when I was 7. Today I speak both Russian and German, English, and some French (badly). I did my Abitur in Karlsruhe, where I also was an undergraduate in physics. I took an excursion to the University of Oslo, where, after learning about physics in space, I decided to let go of Earth entirely and went on to study astrophysics at the University of Potsdam. I did my master's project at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam on stellar flares in open clusters. Since the end of 2018 I have been a happy doctoral student, mostly supervised by <a href="http://katjapoppenhaeger.com/">Katja Poppenhäger</a>. I research stellar flares, and how they affect exoplanets.

     My research interests include: stellar magnetic activity, (magnetic) star-planet interactions, and the solar-stellar connection. Otherwise I care about better science and institutions, practical ethics, equity and inclusion, green politics, and how humanity may survive the next couple of millenia and beyond.

     I spend my leisure time reading, drinking coffee, meditating, listening to music, painting, dancing and walking around Potsdam. Many of these things are done while petting my cat Tom.
