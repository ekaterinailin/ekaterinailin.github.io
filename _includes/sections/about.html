     I was born in Moscow, but my parents took me to Germany (Jülich) when I was 7. Today I speak both Russian and German, English, and some French (badly). I did my Abitur in Karlsruhe, where I also did an undergraduate in physics. I took an excursion to the University of Oslo, where, after learning about physics in space, I decided to let go of Earth entirely and went on to study astrophysics at the University of Potsdam. I did my master's project at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam on stellar flares in open clusters. During my PhD studies, I was wonderfully supervised by <a href="http://katjapoppenhaeger.com/">Katja Poppenhäger</a>. I research stellar flares, and how they affect exoplanets. Recently, I spent some time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York as a Fulbright scholar. As a postdoc, I am working on X-ray observations of low mass stars, flaring star-planet interactions, and stellar magnetic fields. Most recently, I am exploring these phenomena in the radio domain.

     My research interests include: stellar magnetic activity, (magnetic) star-planet interactions, and extreme natural phenomena. Otherwise I care about better science and institutions, practical ethics, equity and inclusion, and how humanity may survive the next couple of millenia and beyond.

     I spend my leisure time reading a lot. My cat Tom is probably around.
