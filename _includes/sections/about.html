     I was born in Moscow, but my parents took me to Germany (Jülich) when I was 7. Today I speak both Russian and German, English, and some French. I did my Abitur in Karlsruhe, where I also was an undergraduate in physics. I took an excursion to the University of Oslo, where, after learning about physics in space, I decided to let go of Earth entirely and went on to study astrophysics at the University of Potsdam. I did my master's project at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam on stellar flares in open clusters. Since the end of 2018 I have been a happy doctoral student, mostly supervised by <a href="http://katjapoppenhaeger.com/">Katja Poppenhäger</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahjaneschmidt.com/p/welcome_22.html">Sarah J. Schmidt</a>

     My research interests include: stellar magnetic activity, (magnetic) star-planet interactions, and the solar-stellar connection. Otherwise I care about existential/suffering risks for sentient beings, better science and insitutions, practical and population ethics, and green politics.

     When I don't study stars, I work to build an sustainable and producte Effective Altruism community in Germany. Currently, I am serving as head of the board at the <a href="https://ealokal.de/en/"> Netzwerk für Effektiven Altruismus Deutschland e. V.</a></div>

     I spend my leisure time reading, meditating, drinking coffee, dancing and walking around Potsdam. Check out <a href="https://jemathfischer.github.io/about.html">Jens Fischer</a> for a cool data science person.
