## How do you spot a good supervisor?

There is, of course, a lot of chance in all of this. But you can avoid major mistakes in interviews with potential supervisors, their students (former and present). It is worth your time if you consider spending the next few year working mostly with that person. This is heavier than sharing your apartment with someone you do not yet know.
