*Figure 4: The ambiguity between latitude and inclination. The four stars have four distinct inclination-latitude combinations, but you cannot tell apart the ones marked in blue by looking at the hiding time of a flaring region. The hiding time is the portion of a stellar rotation during which a flaring region in the red strip is not visible to us. Credit: own work
