I’m an astrophysicist studying the magnetic activity of low-mass stars and how it interacts with their orbiting planets. I focus on how stellar magnetism shapes planetary environments, using optical, X-ray and radio signals to trace these interactions. My work combines time-domain observations from space telescopes like TESS and CHEOPS with physical modeling and statistical methods.

I hold a PhD in astrophysics from the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam and currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON). I’m also active in mentoring, and public outreach.  
Feel free to explore my [CV](./cv.html) or read more about my [research and publications](./publications.html).
